    	<p class="has-text-justified">The Mayans used a base-20 system for calculating large numbers, and that system used a combination of 0s (shell), 1s (dot), and 5s (bar). They also would count vertically, with the next higher block being a 20x increase. The first block is face value of dots/bars/shell, the second block would be 20 times its combination of dots and bars. The third block, 20 times 20 times larger.</p>
